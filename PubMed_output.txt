The RAS isoforms are frequently mutated in many types of human cancers, including PAX3/PAX7 fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma. Pediatric RMS arises from skeletal muscle progenitor cells that have failed to differentiate normally. The role of mutant RAS in this differentiation blockade is incompletely understood. We demonstrate that oncogenic RAS, acting through the RAF-MEK [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase]-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) MAPK effector pathway, inhibits myogenic differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma by repressing the expression of the prodifferentiation myogenic transcription factor, MYOG. This repression is mediated by ERK2-dependent promoter-proximal stalling of RNA polymerase II at the MYOG locus. Small-molecule screening with a library of mechanistically defined inhibitors showed that RAS-driven RMS is vulnerable to MEK inhibition. MEK inhibition with trametinib leads to the loss of ERK2 at the MYOG promoter and releases the transcriptional stalling of MYOG expression. MYOG subsequently opens chromatin and establishes super-enhancers at genes required for late myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, trametinib, in combination with an inhibitor of IGF1R, potently decreases rhabdomyosarcoma cell viability and slows tumor growth in xenograft models. Therefore, this combination represents a potential therapeutic for RAS-mutated rhabdomyosarcoma.

Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Identifying the critical players in this process might be crucial for the generation of novel and effective anti-neoplastic therapies. In the present investigation, we determined the importance of carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), a central player in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism in the liver, on the development of HCC in in vitro and in vivo models. We found that genetic deletion of ChREBP (that will be referred to as ChREBPKO mice) strongly delays or impairs hepatocarcinogenesis driven by AKT or AKT/c-Met overexpression in mice, respectively. In contrast, HCC development was found to be completely unaffected by ChREBP depletion in mice co-expressing AKT and N-Ras protooncogenes. In mouse and human HCC cell lines, suppression of ChREBP via specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) resulted in decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Of note, these cellular events were strongly augmented by concomitant inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The present data indicate that ChREBP activity might be required or dispensable for HCC growth, depending on the oncogenes involved. In particular, the activation of Ras/MAPK signaling might represent a possible mechanism of resistance to ChREBP depletion in this tumor type. Additional studies are needed to unravel the molecular mechanisms rendering HCC cells insensitive to ChREBP suppression.

Kushui rose (R. Setate x R. Rugosa) (KR) is a traditional Chinese medicine proven to be a potent antioxidant, and used for thousands of years. Approximately 30% of all human cancers relevant to mutational activated Ras, and over-activated Ras are accompanied by increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, one way of developing anticancer drugs is to reduce ROS accumulation. Therefore, KR was predicted to have potential to combat over-activated Ras-related cancer. C. elegans with let60(gf)/ras mutant, which exhibited tumor-like symptoms of the multivulva phenotype, was employed to determine the effect of KR on Ras/MAPK pathway. Other strains of worms and H2DCF-DA dye were also applied to study the antioxidant stress capacity of KR. This study was aimed to determine whether KR has a potential effect on combat over-activated Ras-related cancer through resistance to oxidative stress. Our results showed that Kushui rose decoction (KRD) has potent antioxidant activity in vitro, and can inhibit over-activated Ras in vivo. Further, KRD significantly suppressed over-activated Ras/MAPK pathway by regulating oxidative stress-related proteins, such as forkhead transcription factor (DAF-16), glutathione S-transferase-4 (GST-4), superoxide dismutases (SODs) and heat shock protein-16.2 (HSP-16.2). However, essential oil and hydrosol of KR had no effect on over-activated Ras. Thus these results reminded us that people usually soak rose in hot water to prepare 'rose tea' as an effective way for health care. Thus, KRD was demonstrated to be a potential drug candidate for combating over-activated Ras-related cancer as an antioxidant.

Exome-sequencing for somatic mutation detection and copy number variation analysis are effective and valid methods for evaluating human cancers in current molecular medicine. We conducted target amplicon exome-sequencing analyses using PCR target enrichment and next-generation sequencing on Ion Proton semiconductor sequencers. Twenty-seven primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) specimens and their corresponding noncancerous tissues were used for multiplex PCR amplification to obtain targeted coverages of the entire coding regions of 409 cancer-related genes. The average of the total numbers of somatic mutations including single-nucleotide variations and insertion/deletion mutations in each specimen was 13.3. Of these, the average of the ratios of nonsynonymous substitutions in each specimen was 74.8%. The most frequent mutations in 27 specimens were in PIM1, MYD88, CD79B, DST, IRF4, ERBB3, MYH11, DCC, and KMT2D. Furthermore, somatic mutations of MYH11 were related to poor prognoses in PCNSL patients. Copy number variations were also duplicated and/or deleted from deep-sequencing in segmental genomic islands. In addition to these prognostic marker candidates, analysis of RTK-RAS-MAPK signaling and the PTEN-PI3K-AKT proapoptotic pathway showed that somatic activations and aberrations, respectively, may be involved in a promising central oncopathway harboring mTOR, c-Myc, FOXO1, and p53. This study provides a foundation for molecular targeted therapies based on genome diagnostics and prognosis in PCNSL.

Guajadial, one of natural dialdehyde meroterpenoids, demonstrated significant antineoplasmic activity. The present research was to investigate the inhibitory effects of guajadial by using two NSCLC cells (A549 and H1650) proliferation and migration. Western blotting was employed to explore the underlying mechanisms of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)2-mediated. This research indicated that guajadial not only inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and migration but also suppress tumor growth in human NSCLC xenograft mouse models. It is also suggested that guajadial inhibited A549 proliferation via blocking the Ras/MAPK pathway.

Noonan syndrome (NS; Mendelian Inheritance in Men (MIM) musical sharp163950) and related syndromes (Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NS-ML, formerly called LEOPARD syndrome; MIM musical sharp151100), Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS-LAH; MIM musical sharp607721), Costello syndrome (CS; MIM musical sharp218040), Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous syndrome (CFCS; MIM musical sharp115150), type I Neurofibromatosis (NF1; MIM musical sharp162200), and Legius syndrome (LS; MIM musical sharp611431)) are a group of related genetic disorders, associating distinctive facial features, cardiopathies, growth and skeletal abnormalities, developmental delay/mental retardation, and tumor predisposition. Clinically described more than 50 years ago, disease genes have been identified throughout the three last decades, providing a molecular basis to better understand their physiopathology and to identify targets for therapeutic strategies. Most of those genes encode proteins belonging to or regulating the so-called RAS/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, so that these syndromes have been gathered under the naming Rasopathies. In this review, we will provide a clinical overview of Rasopathies and an update of their genetics. We will then focus on the functional and pathophysiological impacts of Rasopathies-causing mutations, and discuss therapeutic perspectives and future directions.

Mutant KRAS represents one of the most frequently observed oncogenes in NSCLC, yet no therapies are approved for tumors that express activated KRAS variants. While there is strong rationale for the use of MEK inhibitors to treat tumors with activated RAS/MAPK signaling, these have proven ineffective clinically. We therefore implemented a CRISPR screening approach to identify novel agents to sensitize KRAS mutant NSCLC cells to MEK inhibitor treatment. This approach identified multiple components of the canonical RAS/MAPK pathway consistent with previous studies. In addition, we identified MAPK7 as a novel, strong hit and validated this finding using multiple orthogonal approaches including knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. We show that MAPK7 inhibition attenuates the re-activation of MAPK signaling occurring following long-term MEK inhibition, thereby illustrating that MAPK7 mediates pathway reactivation in the face of MEK inhibition. Finally, genetic knockdown of MAPK7 combined with the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib in a mutant KRAS NSCLC xenograft model to mediate improved tumor growth inhibition. These data highlight that MAPK7 represents a promising target for combination treatment with MEK inhibition in KRAS mutant NSCLC.

The ability of C. albicans to switch between yeast to hyphal form is a property that is primarily associated with the invasion and virulence of this human pathogenic fungus. Several GPI anchored proteins are expressed only during hyphal morphogenesis. One of the major pathways that controls hyphal morphogenesis is the Ras signaling pathway. We examine the cross-talk between GPI anchor biosynthesis and Ras signaling in C. albicans We show that the first step of GPI biosynthesis is activated by Ras in C. albicans This is diametrically opposite to what is reported in S. cerevisiae Of the two C. albicans Ras proteins, CaRas1 alone activates GPI-GnT activity; activity is further stimulated by constitutively activated CaRas1. CaRas1 localized to cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is sufficient for GPI-GnT activation. Of the six subunits of the GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (GPI-GnT) that catalyzes the first step of GPI biosynthesis, CaGpi2 is the key player involved in activating Ras signaling and hyphal morphogenesis. Activation of Ras signaling is independent of the catalytic competence of GPI-GnT. This too is unlike what is observed in S. cerevisiae where multiple subunits were identified as inhibiting Ras2. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies indicate a specific physical interaction between CaRas1 and CaGpi2 in the ER which would explain the ability of CaRas1 to activate GPI-GnT. CaGpi2, in turn, promotes activation of the Ras signaling pathway and hyphal morphogenesis. The Cagpi2 mutant is also more susceptible to macrophage-mediated killing and macrophage cells show better survival when co-cultured with Cagpi2.

Melanoma is often characterized by a constitutively active RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. For targeted therapy, BRAF inhibitors are available that are powerful in the beginning but resistance occurs rather fast. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance is urgently needed to increase the success of the treatment. Here, we observed that SOX2 and CD24 are upregulated upon BRAF inhibitor treatment. A similar upregulation was seen in targeted therapy-resistant, melanoma-derived induced pluripotent cancer cells (iPCCs). SOX2 and CD24 are known to promote an undifferentiated and cancer stem cell-like phenotype associated with resistance. We, therefore, elucidated the role of SOX2 and CD24 in targeted therapy resistance in more detail. We found that the upregulation of SOX2 and CD24 required activation of STAT3 and that SOX2 induced the expression of CD24 by binding to its promoter. We find that the overexpression of SOX2 or CD24 significantly increases the resistance towards BRAF inhibitors, while SOX2 knock-down rendered cells more sensitivity towards treatment. The overexpression of CD24 or SOX2 induced Src and STAT3 activity. Importantly, by either CD24 knock-down or Src/STAT3 inhibition in resistant SOX2-overexpressing cells, the sensitivity towards BRAF inhibitors was re-established. Hence, we suggest a novel mechanism of adaptive resistance whereby BRAF inhibition is circumvented via the activation of STAT3, SOX2 and CD24. Thus, to prevent adaptive resistance it might be beneficial to combine Src/STAT3 inhibitors together with MAPK pathway inhibitors. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

This experiment focuses on the effect of Yunkang oral liquid on abortion rate, endocrine system and VEGF signal pathway in Clark classical recurrent abortion model mice. RSA mice were randomly divded into model group, low, middle and high-dose groups and progesterone group. The normal pregnancy mice were included into normal group. Since the first day of pregnancy, the normal group and the RSA model group were given the same dose of distilled water, while low, middle and high-dose groups were given Yunkang oral liquid at the dose of 9, 18, 36 mL.kg(1).d(-)(1); progesterone group were given progesterone by 0.039 g.kg(1).d(-)(1). The mice were put to deathat the 15th day of pregnancy, and the embryo loss rate of each group was observed. Serum estradiol (E(2)), progesterone (P), prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level were tested; the protein expressions of estrogen receptor(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), prolactin receptor (PRLR) in decidua and RAS, MAPK, VEGF, VEGFR-2 gene and protein expressions in deciduas were studied. The results showed that middle, high dose Yunkang and progesterone could significantly decrease the embryo loss rate of RSA mice. The levels of FSH, LH, PRL, P and E(2) in serum in Yunkang and progesterone groups were increased, and the serum levels of FSH, LH, and E(2) in Yunkang group were higher than those in progesterone group. Western blot analysis showed that Yunkang oral liquid and progesterone can significantly increase the expressions of PRLR, PR in the uterine decidua of RSA mice, and the expression of ER in Yunkang group was higher than that in progesterone group. Western blot and PCR showed that the Yunkang oral liquid and progesterone can significantly increase RAS, MAPK, VEGF, VEGFR-2 gene and protein expressions in the uterine decidua of RSA mice. The results showed that Yunkang oral liquid can effectively reduce the embryo loss rate of RSA model mice, increase the levels of FSH, LH, PRL, P and E(2) in serum, promote the expressions of PRLR, PR, ER protein in decidua and the RAS, MAPK, VEGF, VEGFR-2 gene and protein expressions in the decidua, improve the vascular remodeling of fetal interface, the endometrial receptivty, the development of decidua and the blastocyst implantation.
